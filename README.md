1. What is the business problem? Project proposal
2. Data Wrangling: Removing inconsistent datatypes, misspelled attributes, duplicate values and adding missing data 
3. Exploratory data analysis: Data visualization and Communication 
4. Preprocessing and training: data transformation, defines and refines the selection of feature variables that will be used in the model development  
5. Data Modeling: used to identify the model that best fits the business requirement (Box-Cox, ARIMA).
