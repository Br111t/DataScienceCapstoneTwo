We can address the duplication along with the missing values for the soveriegn state before summing all of the vaccinations.

Comparing the total vaccinations column with the people vaccinated, there are values which are misaligned, and as we saw earlier, almost half of the data is missing from the people vaccinated column. From my understanding about the data this duplication of columns would lead to more questions than answers. Also, as mentioned before the daily vaccinations raw - was simply for data checks and transparency, most of the computation will be based off of daily vaccinations. Therefore, three columns will be removed: people vaccinated, people vaccinated per hundred and daily vaccination raw. "

    "Based on the graph above there would be very few meaningfull entries for daily vaccinations in the millions. It is a very optomistic outlook, however, most of the entries would be very small and the data that is present does not appear to have values that make computational sense. We can remove the daily vaccinations per million column and calculate the new values for the total vaccinations per hundred based on the numbers that were calculated earlier for total number of vaccinations."
